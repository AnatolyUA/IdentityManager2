IdentityManager2 is a tool for developers and/or administrators to manage the identity information for users of their applications in ASP.NET Core. This includes creating users, editing user information (passwords, email, claims, etc.) and deleting users. It provides a modern replacement for the ASP.NET WebSite Administration tool that used to be built into Visual Studio.

IdentityManager2 is a development tool and is not designed to be used in production. For production identity management see [AdminUI](https://www.identityserver.com/products).
